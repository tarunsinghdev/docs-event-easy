So before we start let's first look at what we'll be building and what will be the look and feel of our website so that you are motivated enough to continue.

## What We'll be building

We'll be building a fully fletched **Events** app where a user will be able to **_create events_, _join events_, _authenticate_, _follow/unfollow_ **users, and most of all **_chat(comment & reply)_** to events.

If that sounds interesting to you stick around and we'll learn to build all that.

## Finished Website

**Live Website : [Event Easy](https://events-easy.firebaseapp.com/)**
