 title : Scaffolding the App
---

In this section we actually start with a high level overview of the app. We'll break down our app into components and we'll try to build one componet at a time.

## Breaking into Components

### Home Page

This will be our landing page of our app. We'll try to keep it simple and clean.

### Navigation Bar

This like other navigation bars will manage our _routes_ of our apps.

### Authentication

We'll be using Email/Password, Facebook and Google for authentication.

### Events Page

All the Events available will be listed on this page.

### Event Detailed Page

This page will contain all the details of the event. Also this page will be equipped with chat functionality.

### Chat component

When we are at the Event Detailed Page users will be able to _Comment & Reply_ related to the selected event.

### Profile Page

All the details about the user will appear on this page.

**So enough scaffolding, let's look into the working of these component from the next section.**
