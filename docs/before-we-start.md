title: Before We Start
---

In this section we'll have a **quick walkthrough** of the _tools and framework_ we'll be using. So that we'll be familiar with the frameworks when we apply them in our project in the upcoming sections. <br/>

If you already know these, feel free to skip this section and continue to the next section - [Working](Introduction).<br/> But if you want to have a quick revision of the concepts, stick around for a fun section ahead.

:::note

If you plan to skip this section and encounter some problem ahead in the sections don't forget to get back to this section as there might be already a solution available for your problem.
