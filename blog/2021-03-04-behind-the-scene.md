**_Learning things and implementing them is the real deal_.** I was aware of the fact and with the new concepts I learned, I wanted to have a final grasp on my newly equipped skills. What's better than implementing the skills and bringing your ideas to life. I took this as a challenge and continued.

## üí° The idea

Four hours straight into thinking, I was running out of ideas. Problem was that I wanted my project to sound unique and that it should be helpful to the people around me. I was always fascinated by how social media worked. But there were already many projects built in this domain. I knew that it would be a great learning experience so I sat for yet another hour to improvize the thought. The previous day I was watching a **React conference** and I was amazed by the knowledge those people possessed. And voila... I had my idea, what if I build a website focussed on events. The event's website where people could come together **join and host** events. It sounded unique and I was confirmed with the idea.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting further

With the basic idea confirmed now it was time to make the website feature-rich. I was getting ready with my idea on paper. Though the idea sounded good to me, there was something extra I could add to it. How about if the user can **chat** about the events with other users and **filter** the events to which they are hosting or attending.

With the skills in my bag, I was confident that I can implement the features. I penned down my complete idea on paper and got started.

## üåß The Challenges

It is rightly said you learn by building projects and I could experience the process.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Conclusion

I managed to bring my idea to life. With so much learning involved in the process, I'm satisfied how it came out.<br/>
I believe in learning together with the community. I write about the things I learned and applied. You can find more blogs [here](https://tarunsingh.hashnode.dev/)

‚ö°Ô∏è Happy Learning.
